# Stickers from the 2019 Sitecore Symposium and MVP Summit

Another year, some more silly stickers for Symposium and the MVP summit. [The ones from previous years are <a href="https://github.com/jermdavis/SymposiumStickers2017">here (2017)</a> and <a href="https://github.com/jermdavis/SymposiumStickers2018">here (2018)</a>]

The files are available in Photoshop format, and as PNGs below.
They're under an "<a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/">attribution, share-alike</a>" license so if you've got customisations you'd like to make, go ahead.
Just give the artwork back to the community and link back to this repo.

For Symposium, I used <a href="https://www.stickermule.com/uk/custom-stickers">Sticker Mule</a> to print copies of these, and the quality was great.
It's a bit hidden, but they also have <a href="https://www.stickermule.com/samples/stickers">an "order samples" option</a>, which lets you get smaller numbers if you only need a few (or to check out your designs).
